#!/bin/sh

# This script will output the latest file in a directory. One use case is to
# open the latest file in a directory with a command like `open
# $(latest-in-dir)`. I generally symlink this to ~/bin/lid. One particularly
# common case is to operate on ~/Downloads, eg. vi `lid ~/Downloads`.

if [ -n "$1" ]; then
    printf "$1"/
    cd "$1"
fi
/bin/echo -n 'lid: ' >&2
ls -tr | grep -v DS_Store | tail -n 1 | tee /dev/stderr
