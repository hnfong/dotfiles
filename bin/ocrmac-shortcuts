# This program uses the macOS Shortcuts app to perform Optical Character
# Recognition (OCR) on an image file. It then prints the extracted text to the
# console.

# Note that we don't have to add the clipboard step as described in the blog
# post, the shortcut already outputs the text to stdout. The clipboard step is
# optional and only needed if we want to immediately use it in the clipboard,
# which we don't really want to here as a utility command.
