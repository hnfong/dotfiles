# What seemed to work for me was going into System Settings > Privacy &
# Security > Accessibility > toggling permissions OFF for Automator, Script
# Editor, Shortcuts. I then quit the System Settings, then opened it again and
# re-enabled all three. That allowed the Apple Script to run again.

# Extra-extra note: You may have to actually open the Automator app and run
# `tell application "System Events" to keystroke 'x'` to get things running. If
# you just run this in the command line it may not work. But if the UI app
# starts working, then the command line thing will work.

echo "tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"$1\"" | osascript
