#!/bin/bash

# This program is designed to search for files in the current directory and its
# subdirectories, replacing occurrences of a specified string ( `FROM`) with
# another string (`TO`). It generates a list of commands to move the original
# files to a backup location while renaming them to the new string. Note that
# 'FROM' is a regex, so you must escape special characters like '.' with '\.'
#
# Review the list of commands and confirm by typing `y` when prompted. If
# you confirm, the script will execute the `mv` commands to rename the files.
#
# Usage:
#    mass_rename old_string new_string
